		<h1>Websites</h1>
		<p><b>Overview</b><br><br>I started learning to create websites this fall, and since, I have created a few different websites and programs, all of which are mobile responsive.</p>
			
		<h2>This Website</h2>
		<img src="portfolioMobile.png" width="100%">
		<p><a href="index.html" target="_blank">This website</a> is my most recent. It was created from scratch as a platform for me to share my work and resume. I also utilized my skills in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to create the graphics for this site.I started with a general idea of wanting to let people understand my experiences and expertise, so the purpose of this page is to convey this.<br><br>My first priority in making this website was to make it easy to follow nd simple to understand. Thus, it is very straightforward and features a plain, sleak design, so the content really stands out. I stuck with a clean color scheme and straightforward page layout. I also stuck with shorter paragraphs, so people are not overwelmed with text. <br><br> I also made this website mobile-friendly, so it can reach a wider array of people. To do this, I focused on making the horizontal desktop layout into a more vertical, stacked layout. </p>
		
		<h2>My First Website</h2>
		<img src="firstSite.png" width="100%">
		<p> <a href="https://margaretkcook.github.io/cookAssignment2/index.html" target="_blank">My first website</a>, though very basic, was designed as a food and lifestyle blog, which I used as a platform to master the fundamentals HTML/CSS and mobile design. While creating it, I emphasized simplicity and ease in navigation. <br><br></p>
